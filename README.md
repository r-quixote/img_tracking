**2DO:**
- [X] add tracking for second point in order to track angle between 2 points
- [ ] can't got to manual when tracking multiple points

**2DO - not really important:**
- [ ] add brightness controll to img_procesing.py - maybe auto brightness correction for imgs with natural lighting

_**2DO someday (maybe...):**_
- [ ] add GUI (browser based app?)
