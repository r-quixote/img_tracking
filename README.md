# cropping for folder, convert imgs to video, tracker2.1 
in the testing env...

tracker can be paused for manual tracking


2DO:
 ~~* add tracking for second point in order to track angle between 2 points~~
* can't got to manual when tracking multiple points


2DO - not really important:
* add brightness controll to img_procesing.py - maybe auto brightness correction for imgs with natural lighting

2DO someday (maybe...):
* add GUI
