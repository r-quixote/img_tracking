# cropping for folder, convert imgs to video, tracker2.1 



------------
##### need to add *how to* section
------------
##### whats new:
* tracker can be paused with 'p' for manual tracking.
* several types of tracker can be used at the same time.
* several initial rois can be selected at begining of video


##### needs to be done:
**2DO:**
- [X] add tracking for second point in order to track angle between 2 points
- [] can't got to manual when tracking multiple points

**2DO - not really important:**
- [] add brightness controll to img_procesing.py - maybe auto brightness correction for imgs with natural lighting

_**2DO someday (maybe...):**_
- [] add GUI (browser based app?)
