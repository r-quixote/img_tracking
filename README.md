##### whats new:
* tracker can be paused with 'p' for manual tracking.
* several types of tracker can be used at the same time.
* several initial rois can be selected at begining of video

**2DO:**
* ~~add tracking for second point in order to track angle between 2 points~~
* can't got to manual when tracking multiple points

**2DO - not really important:**
* add brightness controll to img_procesing.py - maybe auto brightness correction for imgs with natural lighting

_**2DO someday (maybe...):**_
