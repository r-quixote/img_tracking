# cropping for folder, convert imgs to video, tracker2.1 
------------

keep in mind that this was written to be used with an open terminal - seeing the printed msgs from the script
------------
##### need to add *how to use tracker* section here
------------

##### whats new:
* tracker can be paused with 'p' for manual tracking.
* several types of tracker can be used at the same time.
* several initial rois can be selected at begining of tracking
* added timestamp to img cropping

------------
**2DO:**
- [X] ~~add tracking for second point in order to track angle between 2 points~~
- [ ] can't go to manual when tracking multiple points
	- [ ] manual still needs 
- [ ] add run from terminal


**2DO - not really important:**
- [ ] add brightness controll to img_procesing.py - maybe auto brightness correction for imgs with natural lighting
- [ ] clean up progress bar mess
- [ ] add help section for img_procesing
- [ ] add cropping several parts to cropping.py
- [X] add timestamp to crop last img
- [ ] linux compatible?
  

_**2DO someday (maybe...):**_
- [ ] add GUI (browser based app?)
